## Adaptable and light

I optimize for portability with my office setup, while trying to keep the ergonomy acceptable. This allows me to work from pretty much anywhere. I use this setup in 3 different main modes:

## Full

This is the most ergonomic setup, as it enables me to get the top of the screen at eye level (as is widely suggested, see [Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety](https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/office/monitor_positioning.html){:target="\_blank"} for example). When I'm at home, or can bring everything this is my preferred setup.

The laptop stand is the [Rooster Laptop Stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C9KG8IG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01C9KG8IG&linkCode=as2&tag=journeydev-20&linkId=042884ade1aac61b5429cebdb1cd67bb){:target="\_blank"}. It folds together and takes up very little space in the bag.

The keyboard is [Logitech Keys-To-Go Ultra-Portable Bluetooth Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VUK4R08/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00VUK4R08&linkCode=as2&tag=journeydev-20&linkId=def6668039540d991c443a44ecdd6185){:target="\_blank"}. It's super slim and can fit in any computer bag without problem. It doesn't have F-keys though, which has made me look for an alternative to this.

The mouse is [Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Mouse 3600](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015HWLB2G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B015HWLB2G&linkCode=as2&tag=journeydev-20&linkId=43a2fa24345469ab47fed9fe7c3c89a4){:target="\_blank"}. Keeping it simple here! This mouse has served me well for many years.

## Medium

Sometimes it's easier to go with just the mouse. No need to bring and set up the stand and external keyboard. I use this mostly for shorter bursts of work while traveling when I might have limited space in my bag.

## Ultra light

<em>You can see that the keyboard has seen better days. It's been around the block a few times...</em>

The [Keys-To-Go](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VUK4R08/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00VUK4R08&linkCode=as2&tag=journeydev-20&linkId=def6668039540d991c443a44ecdd6185){:target="\_blank"} comes with a smartphone stand. You can also use a glass to just lean the phone against and type away. This comes in handy if you don't want to bring the laptop but still want a better typing experience than what the smartphone keyboard gives you. Perfect for coffee shops, when inspiration strikes!
