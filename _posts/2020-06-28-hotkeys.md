## Shave off seconds - save hours

It might seem like nothing—reaching for the mouse or trackpad to close a window or move the cursor takes only a fraction of a second—but it breaks your flow and accumulates to great swaths of time you can use to get the work done instead. There are general hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts) that work globally across many different applications, and other software specific ones. I’m on Windows, but will include the Mac equivalents where it is available.

## General Hotkeys

### Cursor control

This will speed up your navigation in text and code editors by a lot. Every time you find yourself reaching for the mouse to place your cursor, it would probably be faster to navigate using keys.

<hr>

<u>Jump word-by-word</u>

I sometimes see people hold the right or left key down to get the cursor to the desired place on the line. With <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+left/right`</span> you will jump on word at a time instead which will be much faster. Combine this with Shift, <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+Shift+left/right`</span> to mark the words at the same time (for deletion, move or copy/paste).

<hr>

<u>Jump to beginning/end of line</u>

Self-explanatory but often overlooked. <span class="bg-black">`Home`</span> and <span class="bg-black">`End`</span> buttons on the keyboard will do this.

<hr>

<u>Jump up/down in the document</u>

This is faster than reaching for the mouse and dragging your way down or using the trackpad.
<span class="bg-black">`PgUp/PgDown`</span>

### Navigate tabs

This is especially useful in browsers such as Chrome or Firefox. It works in most applications that utilize tabs though (VS Code, for example). Jumping back and forward, closing tabs, open the one you just closed

<u>Close tabs</u>

Windows: <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+w`</span>

Mac: <span class="bg-black">`Cmd+w`</span>

<hr>

<u>Open most recently closed tab</u>

This is useful when you use the above hotkey too fast.

Windows: <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+Shift+t`</span>

Mac: <span class="bg-black">`Cmd+Shift+t`</span>

<hr>

<u>Next/previous tab</u>

Windows/Mac: <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+Tab`</span> (next), <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+Shift+Tab`</span> (previous)
You can also jump straight to specific tabs with: <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+[number]`</span>, for example, tab number 5 is: <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+5`</span>. The last tab is always at: <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+9`</span>.

### Organize open windows

This will make you faster in setting up and organizing your desktop environment.

<u>Close current application/window</u>
Windows: <span class="bg-black">`Alt+F4`</span>
Mac: <span class="bg-black">`Cmd+q`</span>

<hr>

<u>Move your windows around</u>

This is useful for splitting your working space to work concurrently in many applications at the same time. You might want Excel on one half on the screen and your text editor on the other, for example.
Windows: <span class="bg-black">`Windows button+direction key`</span>
For example, the Windows button and right will put the window on the right half of your screen and let you choose what to display on the other half:

<hr>

<u>Open Explorer</u>

Windows: <span class="bg-black">`Windows button+e`</span>

Mac: <span class="bg-black">`Option+Command+Space`</span>

<hr>

<u>Shift between open windows</u>

Essential for jumping between open applications and windows.

Windows: <span class="bg-black">`Alt+Tab`</span>. Use <span class="bg-black">`Alt+Ctrl+Shift`</span> to get an overview of all open windows.

Mac: <span class="bg-black">`Cmd+Tab`</span> (switch between applications) <span class="bg-black">`Cmd+Shift+Tab`</span> (shift between open windows)

### Functionality

<u>Paste unformatted</u>

I don’t think we need to go through copy/paste, but copy unformatted is often overlooked. Sometimes when you paste the text might bring the formatting from wherever it was copied from.

Windows: <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+Shift+V`</span>

Mac: <span class="bg-black">`Command+Shift+Option+V`</span>

### Settings

<u>Change language/keyboard layout</u>

This one is great if you write in different languages. It saves me a lot of time going between Swedish and English keyboard as the layout is different.

Windows: <span class="bg-black">`Alt+Shift`</span>

Mac: <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+Space`</span>

## Custom hotkeys

It starts getting really powerful when you customize the hotkeys to your specific use cases. Most applications will let you map keyboard combinations as you wish.

<u>Start applications</u>

I have Chrome at <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+Alt+c`</span>, VS Code at <span class="bg-black">`Ctrl+Alt+V`</span> and so on. You set these hotkeys (in Windows) by right-clicking the shortcut to the application and select properties:

<img class="half-image" src="/assets/post-media/2020-06-28/chrome_hotkey.png"/>

This lets me have my desktop clean, as I don't need to have shortcuts on the desktop, as described [here]({% post_url 2020-06-17-digital-minimalism-2-desktop %}):

<hr>

<u>Custom Search Engines</u>

In Chrome, you can save time by mapping hotkeys to search functionality on your favorite sites. Right-click the address field and choose “Edit search engines…”:

![search engines](/assets/post-media/2020-06-28/search_engines.png "search engines")

For example, I have:

![search engines](/assets/post-media/2020-06-28/search_engines2.png "search engines")

And by just typing “gr” and space I can instantly search Goodreads:

![search engines](/assets/post-media/2020-06-28/search_engines3.png "search engines")

Those are a few of the hotkeys I use to save time. There are lots more. Make a habit of stopping for a second if you notice you reach for the mouse. There is probably a better way to do that!
