## Digital intruder

I have always enjoyed the simple pleasure of picking up a physical book. Turning the pages and slowly letting a story unravel, aided by imagination that draws up new environments on the canvas of the mind. A few years ago I added to my collection of physical books a digital intruder—the e-reader. Feared by its analog cousins for more than a decade, it still merely acts as a complement for me. It has many benefits, but also clear drawbacks. It seems the rest of the world agrees. As Meryl Halls, managing director of the Booksellers’ Association in the U.K. told CNBC in an interview:

<em>“I think the e-book bubble has burst somewhat, sales are flattening off, I think the physical object is very appealing. Publishers are producing incredibly gorgeous books, so the cover designs are often gorgeous, they’re beautiful objects”</em>

## E-reader - pros and cons

The first e-reader I got was the [Kobo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KWX0EL4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01KWX0EL4&linkCode=as2&tag=journeydev-20&linkId=7a4f49fd4e1f465f2a489a65bb437c42){:target="\_blank"} Glo HD (link to the newer Aura, same format). It has served me well for 5 years. It has a 6" inch screen which makes it small enough to fit in a jacket or even jeans back pocket. Compared to a Kindle it's not as locked into a specific ecosystem. I just upgraded to [Boox ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KWX0EL4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01KWX0EL4&linkCode=as2&tag=journeydev-20&linkId=7a4f49fd4e1f465f2a489a65bb437c42){:target="\_blank"} Poke2 (link to the bigger Nova2, great for note taking and sketches. Poke2 available in the [official Boox Shop](https://shop.boox.com/){:target="\_blank"}).

<em>Boox Poke2</em>

It is one of the few available models on the market that still have the smaller size (it’s even thinner than Kobe Glo HD). The reason for the upgrade was the backlight. Glo HD only had the cold light and even at 1% brightness it was disruptive for sleep when reading in bed (melatonin increases from blue light exposure). The Boox Poke2 has dynamic warm light.

Following are the pros and cons of e-readers that I have noticed over the last few years, combining physical books with e-books:

<u>Pros</u>

- Backlit. Enables reading anywhere (hotels without reading light, airplanes, cars).
- Can stand. With the right case, you can read easily while eating.
- Built-in dictionaries.
- Share online articles for later reading.
- Easier on the eyes than regular screens.
- Hundreds or even thousands of books carried with you.
- Instant access to books you’re interested in.

<u>Cons</u>

- Hundreds or even thousands of books…
- Instant access to books you’re interested in.
- Time consuming to go back and forward between sections (unless you have set convenient bookmarks).

## The curse of availability

As you can see, the sheer amount of books available at your fingertips is both a blessing and a curse. It can quickly lead to content overload. Before you know it, you have 89 books on the device that you just <em>have</em> to read right now. This is distracting and might cause a certain stress or even guilt for not getting to them all. With physical books, there is also the same issue when gathering lots of books without reading the ones you own, but not at the same level. It’s similar to the difference between physical CDs and today’s streaming services. No one really has the patience or will to listen to a full album and truly appreciate the songs. Back in the days we’d learn the lyrics (flipping through the cover case) and play the CD on repeat until every song was engraved into memory, getting better with each listen. Today we hasten from playlist to playlist, searching for the next big hit. Same with books. Books are however a medium that requires patience. As our attention span shortens, the ease with which you can jump from book to book in the e-reader can become an obstacle to experiencing true joy in reading.

## An attempt to get the best of both worlds

- Set a hard limit on how many books you allow on your e-reader at one time. 5 seems reasonable. A few more for a longer trip.
- Get physical books if you suspect you’ll want to jump back and forward between sections or use it as a reference (example of a book that works best in physical form: Ray Dalio’s Principles).
- Keep the books you want to read in a list on a service such as Goodreads rather than as books on your e-reader, as it becomes too tempting to get started on the latest and greatest right away rather than finish current books.
- Support your local bookstore and get secondhand books whenever you find something that’s on your reading list.
