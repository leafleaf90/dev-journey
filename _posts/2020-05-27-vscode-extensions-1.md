## Visual cues

There are a few extensions that, with small visual cues, makes coding just a little bit easier. The ones I use right now:

**Bracket Pair Colorizer 2**

This can help you understand what is enclosed by what. It simplifies debugging as well as makes you more aware of potential mis-types as they happen. The extension will color the opening and closing brackets that belong together in the same color:

**Color Highlight**

See what color you're setting at a glance.

_A subtle grey, on display_

**Highlight Matching Tag**

Similar help as what Bracket Pair Colorizer gives, but I like how the corresponding opening/closing tag lights up for a few milliseconds when the mathcing tag is clicked.

_Match made in heaven_

**TODO Higlight**

If there is a part of the code you know you'll need to re-visit later, this is great way to set a reminder.

_Note to self, by TODO highlight_

You can find all of these in the Extensions Marketplace in VSCode.

Next I'll do one for extensions that provide extendend functionality.
