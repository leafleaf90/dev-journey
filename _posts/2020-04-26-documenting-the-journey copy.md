## The Starting Point

I have lots of websites running WordPress installations with some theme and sitebuilder, usually Divi with Slider Revolution for some added flair. Divi is good for clients that does not want to deal with markdown and has to update content several times per month or even daily. But performance-wise the sites gets bogged down with all the extra fluff and slows down the user experience, both for visitors but also in the admin area. Also, for many clients it doesn't make sense to run a website with a database. A static website, consisting only of HTML, CSS and some JavaScript is often enough and brings huge performance advantages.

To brush up on long forgotten JS skills along with the not forgotten but certainly rusty HTML and CSS (WordPress can do that to you) i dove into:

Today is Sunday, April 26. Just over a month has passed since I started
the Team Treehouse "Front End Development" course.

## The Opportunity Arises

Nothing bad bad that doesn't also bring some good with it, right? The
corona-crisis brought with it remote work. This still meant getting the
same amount of work done every day. But no commute combined with the
efficiency of working undisturbed did leave more time to dive into other
areas of interest.

## Question of the Day

**What platform/tool should I focus on first?**
Right now I'm writing this straight into my index.html in VS Code.

I'm considering a headless CMS such as
[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and some static site generator magic
such as [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to get things started. I'll do some research.

## Listen of the Day

<p>The podcast Toolsday with an episode called "New or Underrated DevTools"
(<a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/toolsday/308905">episode 102</a>).
Some good, small tips and tricks in there. As a fresh developer I really
like hearing about more experienced developers' software, ways to work or
overall approach to programming. One of the hosts interpreted the topic
as overall tools for development, while the other interpreted it
specifically as about the DevTools in the browser, which gave some extra
dimension. PS: did you know you can hide the element in focus in Chrome
DevTools by clicking the "h" key?</p>
