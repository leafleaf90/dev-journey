## The Starting Point

Learning to code from scratch. I've been at it for a few weeks. As it
helps to have an idea of the timeline we're dealing with here, I made some
detective-worthy research:

Today is Sunday, April 26. Just over a month has passed since I started
the Team Treehouse "Front End Development" course.

## The Opportunity Arises

Nothing bad bad that doesn't also bring some good with it, right? The
corona-crisis brought with it remote work. This still meant getting the
same amount of work done every day. But no commute combined with the
efficiency of working undisturbed did leave more time to dive into other
areas of interest.

## Question of the Day

**What platform/tool should I use for this blog?**
Right now I'm writing this straight into my index.html in VS Code.

I assume I should look into something else. Headless CMS such as
[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and some static site generator magic
such as [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). I'll do some research.

## Listen of the Day

<div class="todays-read">
<img src="/assets/post-media/2020-04-26/toolsday.jpg" />
<p>The podcast Toolsday with an episode called "New or Underrated DevTools"
(<a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/toolsday/308905">episode 102</a>).
Some good, small tips and tricks in there. As a fresh developer I really
like hearing about more experienced developers' software, ways to work or
overall approach to programming. One of the hosts interpreted the topic
as overall tools for development, while the other interpreted it
specifically as about the DevTools in the browser, which gave some extra
dimension. PS: did you know you can hide the element in focus in Chrome
DevTools by clicking the "h" key?</p>
