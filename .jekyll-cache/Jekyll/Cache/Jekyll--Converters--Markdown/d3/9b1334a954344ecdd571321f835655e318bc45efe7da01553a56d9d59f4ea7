<p>I won‚Äôt turn this into a complete clich√© party, but let me just lead with this:
‚ÄúWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going‚Äù</p>

<p>One thing you can be sure of is that there will be times when you feel like you want to give up. This is true of any undertaking in life. Being prepared for this and learning to recognize those times as something natural that you just need to push through is essential. I believe that the most powerful antidote is to learn this lesson in general, not just for programming specifically.</p>

<h2 id="the-dip-the-resistance-and-the-realization">The dip, the resistance and the realization</h2>

<p>I recommend you to read The Dip by Seth Godin. It is a short read that will teach you to recognize when you hit the dip in any venture, and how to tackle it. In this case, since you have decided you want to become a developer, or maybe become a better developer, the answer will be that you must push through the dip. Just know that the dip is coming, sure as night follows day, and reading this book will prepare you for it.</p>

<p>Another short read that helps with the procrastination that can accompany the dip is The War of Art by Steven Pressfield. It will give you tools to battle that dreaded feeling of resistance that stops you from <em>doing the work</em>. Immense value in this book.</p>

<p>Finally, to hammer this home in the domain of programming, I recommend you read <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/" target="\_blank">this article</a> by Erik Trautman. Among other things he describes ‚ÄúThe Desert of Despair‚Äù as <em>‚Äù[‚Ä¶]the long and lonely journey through a pathless landscape where every new direction seems correct but you‚Äôre frequently going in circles and you‚Äôre starving for the resources to get you through it. Beware the ‚ÄúMirages of Mania‚Äù, like sirens of the desert, which will lead you astray.‚Äù</em></p>

<h2 id="surround-yourself-with-reminders">Surround yourself with reminders</h2>

<p>I find it helpful to be exposed to motivating images throughout the day. Sometimes when you feel like giving up, it helps being reminded of the goal. Whatever that means for you - building the next social nextwork, getting your first internship or being hired as advancing your career - you can find images that symobolizes this for you. Set these as backgrounds on your phone and laptop. For example I have this as my phone background:
<img src="/assets/post-media/2020-06-07/mobile-bg.jpg" alt="mobile background" title="Mobile background" /></p>

<h2 id="seek-out-inspiring-content">Seek out inspiring content</h2>

<p>I find it motivating to listen to podcasts discussing the area of programming you‚Äôre currently most into. For example, I mostly do JavaScript and enjoy listening to <a href="https://syntax.fm/">Syntax</a>. You can easily find podcasts about your specific area of study and interest.</p>

<p>I also recommend the short documentaries from Honeypot on YouTube, especially the one on the story of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI&amp;t=7s" target="\_blank">Vue.js</a>, and another one on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783ccP__No8" target="\_blank">GraphQL</a>.</p>

<p>Another inspiring documentary about programming (AI specifically) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y&amp;t=1329s">AlphaGo</a> which is streaming for free on YouTube as well.</p>

<h2 id="take-breaks">Take breaks</h2>

<p>You might be tempted to stay on a problem for hours and hours without breaks (<em>‚ÄúJust 5 more minutes and I‚Äôll have it figured out‚Äù</em>). Learn to walk away if only for 10-15 minutes when you‚Äôve been stuck for a while, and more often than not the solution will come to you either during the break or quite soon upon returning to your computer.</p>

<p>Those are some of the ways I try to keep motivation up. Thanks for reading.</p>
