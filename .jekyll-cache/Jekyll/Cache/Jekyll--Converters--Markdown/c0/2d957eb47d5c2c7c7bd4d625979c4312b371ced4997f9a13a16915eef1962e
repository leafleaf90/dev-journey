<p>I have always enjoyed the simple pleasure of picking up a physical book. Turning the pages and slowly letting a story unravel, aided by imagination that draws up new environments on the canvas of the mind. A few years ago I added to my collection of physical books a digital intruder—the e-reader, feared by its analog cousins for more than a decade. Still, it merely acts as a complement. It has benefits, which I will list below, but also clear drawbacks. It seems the rest of the world agrees. As Meryl Halls, managing director of the Booksellers’ Association in the U.K. told CNBC in an interview:</p>

<p><em>“I think the e-book bubble has burst somewhat, sales are flattening off, I think the physical object is very appealing. Publishers are producing incredibly gorgeous books, so the cover designs are often gorgeous, they’re beautiful objects”</em></p>
