<p>I have lots of websites running WordPress installations with some theme and sitebuilder, usually Divi with Slider Revolution for some added flair.

areas of interest.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm considering a headless CMS such as
<a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and some static site generator magic
such as <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> to get things started. I‚Äôll do some research.</p>
