<p>We are now up and running with static site generator Jekyll! As I mentioned in yesterdayâ€™s post, I canâ€™t manage this is pure html. A few hours research today and weâ€™re good (I think). This is whatâ€™s been done:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Decided to try out Jekyll as a static site generator (Google told me to!)</li>
  <li>Research</li>
  <li>Jekyll is written in Ruby, so step 1 was to install Ruby.
Iâ€™m on Windows so I used the installer package: <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a></li>
</ol>
