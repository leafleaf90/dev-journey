<p>At its core, it’s simple. Sit down and get the work done. Productivity books can seem like just another way to procrastinate. Many times that’s just what it is — thousands of books and Medium articles repeating the same mantras over and over. These three books deliver on their promises though, and the time spent on them pays itself back many times over. The benefits also tend to spill over into all other areas of life, especially from Deep Work and The War of Art.</p>

<p><img class="half-image" src="/assets/post-media/2020-06-21/effectiveexec.jpg" /></p>

<p>Don’t let the title put you off. Drucker’s definition of an executive is basically anyone that makes decisions in an organization. The parts on how to get the right things done also applies largely to anyone working for themselves.</p>

<p>The book teaches you to interpret the situations you encounter, and understand that most of them are variations of things that you have already dealt with. This will help improve decision-making greatly and lets you focus on being productive where it really matters. You can be as productive as you want, but if it’s not in areas that will move the needle, what’s the point?</p>

<p><em>“Are you paralyzed with fear? That’s a good sign. Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do. Remember one rule of thumb: the more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.”</em></p>
