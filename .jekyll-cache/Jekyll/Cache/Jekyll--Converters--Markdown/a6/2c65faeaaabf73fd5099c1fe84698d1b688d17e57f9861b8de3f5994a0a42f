<p>Learning to code from scratch. I’ve been at it for a few weeks. As it
helps to have an idea of the timeline we’re dealing with here, I made some
detective-worthy research:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;img

  alt="Team Treehouse Invoice"
/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Today is Sunday, April 26. Just over a month has passed since I started
  the Team Treehouse "Front End Development" course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Opportunity Arises&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Nothing bad bad that doesn't also bring some good with it, right? The
  corona-crisis brought with it remote work. This still meant getting the
  same amount of work done every day. But no commute combined with the
  efficiency of working undisturbed did leave more time to dive into other
  areas of interest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question of the Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;What platform/tool should I use for this blog?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Right now I'm writing this straight into my index.html in VS Code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img

  alt="VS Code editor"
/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I assume I should look into something else. Headless CMS such as
  &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;? Some static site generator magic
  such as &lt;a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt;? I'll do some research.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Read/Listen of the Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="todays-read"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/blog/blog-img/documenting-the-journey/toolsday.jpg" /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The podcast Toolsday with an episode called "New or Underrated DevTools"
    (&lt;a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/toolsday/308905"&gt;episode 102&lt;/a&gt;).
    Some good, small tips and tricks in there. As a fresh developer I really
    like hearing about more experienced developers software, ways to work or
    overall approach to programming. One of the hosts interpreted the topic
    as overall tools for development, while the other interpreted it
    specifically as about the DevTools in the browser, which gave some extra
    dimension. PS: did you know you can hide the element in focus in Chrome
    DevTools by clicking the "h" key?
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
