<p>It might seem like nothing—reaching for the mouse or trackpad to close a window or move the cursor takes only a fraction of a second—but it breaks your flow and accumulates to great swaths of time you can use to get the work done instead. There are general hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts) that work globally across many different applications, and other software specific ones. I’m on Windows, but will include the Mac equivalents where it is available.</p>

<h2 id="general-hotkeys">General Hotkeys</h2>

<h3 id="cursor-control">Cursor control</h3>

<p>This will speed up your navigation in text and code editors by a lot. Every time you find yourself reaching for the mouse to place your cursor, it would probably be faster to navigate using keys.</p>

<p>Jump word-by-word
I sometimes see people hold the right or left key down to get the cursor to the desired place on the row. With <span class="bg-black"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+left/right</code></span> you will jump on word at a time instead which will be much faster. Combine this with Shift, <span class="bg-black"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Shift+left/right</code></span> to mark the words at the same time (for deletion, move or copy/paste).</p>

<p>Jump to beginning/end of line
Self-explanatory but often overlooked. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Home</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">End</code> buttons on the keyboard will do this.</p>

<p>Jump up/down in the document
This is faster than reaching for the mouse and dragging your way down or using the trackpad.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">PgUp/PgDown</code></p>

<h3 id="navigate-tabs">Navigate tabs</h3>

<p>This is especially useful in browsers such as Chrome or Firefox. It works in most applications that utilize tabs though (VS Code, for example). Jumping back and forward, closing tabs, open the one you just closed</p>

<p>Close tabs
Windows: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+w</code>
Mac: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd+W</code></p>

<p>Open most recently closed tab (very useful when you use the above hotkey too fast)
Windows: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Shift+t</code>
Mac: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd+Shift+t</code></p>

<p>Next/previous tab
Windows/Mac: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Tab</code> (next), <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Shift+Tab</code> (previous)
You can also jump straight to specific tabs with: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+[number]</code>, for example, tab number 5 is: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+5</code>. The last tab is always at: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+9</code>.</p>

<h3 id="navigate-windows">Navigate windows</h3>

<p>This will make you faster in setting up and organizing your desktop environment.</p>

<p>Close current application/window
Windows: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Alt+F4</code>
Mac: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd+q</code></p>

<p>Move your windows around
This is maybe the most useful and under-utilized method for splitting your working space and work concurrently in many applications at the same time. You might want Excel on one half on the screen and your text editor on the other, for example.
Windows: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Windows button+direction key</code>
For example, the Windows button and right will put the window on the right half of your screen and let you choose what to display on the other half:
<img src="/assets/post-media/2020-06-28/split_screen.png" alt="split screen" title="split screen" /></p>

<p>Open Explorer
Windows: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Windows button+e</code>
Mac: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Option+Command+Space</code></p>

<p>Shift between open windows
Essential for jumping between open applications and windows.
Windows: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Alt+Tab</code>. Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Alt+Ctrl+Shift</code> to get an overview of all open windows.
Mac: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd+Tab</code> (switch between applications) <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmd+Shift+Tab</code> (shift between open windows)</p>

<h3 id="functionality">Functionality</h3>

<p>Paste unformatted
I don’t think we need to go through copy/paste, but copy unformatted is often overlooked. Sometimes when you paste the text might bring the formatting from wherever it was copied from.
Windows: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Shift+V</code>
Mac: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Command+Shift+Option+V</code></p>

<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>

<p>Change language/keyboard layout
This one is great if you write in different languages. It saves me a lot of time going between Swedish and English keyboard as the layout is different.
Windows: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Alt+Shift</code>
Mac: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Space</code></p>

<h2 id="custom-hotkeys">Custom hotkeys</h2>

<p>It starts getting really powerful when you customize the hotkeys to your specific use cases. Most applications will let you map keyboard combinations as you wish. For example, you can have certain applications tied to combinations. I have Chrome at <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+c</code>, VS Code at <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+V</code> and so on. This lets me have my desktop clean, for reasons described <a href="/digital-minimalism-2-desktop.html">here</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-media/2020-06-17/empty-desktop.png" alt="empty desktop" title="empty desktop" /></p>

<p>In Chrome, you can save time by mapping hotkeys to search functionality on your favorite sites. Right-click the address field and choose “Edit search engines…”:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-media/2020-06-28/search_engines.png" alt="search engines" title="search engines" /></p>

<p>For example, I have:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-media/2020-06-28/search_engines2.png" alt="search engines" title="search engines" /></p>

<p>And by just typing “gr” and space I can instantly search Goodreads:</p>
