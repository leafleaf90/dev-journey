<p>There are a few extensions that, with small visual cues, makes coding just a little bit easier. The ones I use right now:</p>

<p><strong>Bracket Pair Colorizer 2</strong></p>

<p>This can help you understand what is enclosed by what. It simplifies debugging as well as makes you more aware of potential mis-types as they happen. The extension will color the opening and closing brackets that belong together in the same color:</p>

<em>Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 in action</em></p>

<p><strong>Color Highlight</strong></p>

<p>See what color youâ€™re setting at a glance.</p>

<em>A subtle grey, on display</em></p>

<p><strong>Highlight Matching Tag</strong></p>

<p>Similar help as what Bracket Pair Colorizer gives, but I like how the corresponding opening/closing tag lights up for a few milliseconds when the mathcing tag is clicked.</p>

<em>Match made in heaven</em></p>

<p><strong>TODO Higlight</strong></p>

<p>If there is a part of the code you know youâ€™ll need to re-visit later, this is great way to set a reminder.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\post-media\2020-05-23\todo.png" alt="TODO Higlight" title="TODO Higlight Extension" />
<em>Note to self, by TODO highlight</em></p>

<p>You can find all of these in the Extensions Marketplace in VSCode.</p>

<p>Next Iâ€™ll do one for extensions that provide extendend functionality.</p>
