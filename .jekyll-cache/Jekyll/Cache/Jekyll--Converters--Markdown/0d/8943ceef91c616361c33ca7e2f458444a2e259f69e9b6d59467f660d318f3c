<p>I optimize for portability with my office setup, while trying to keep the ergonomy acceptable. This allows me to work from pretty much anywhere. I use this setup in 3 different main modes:</p>

<h2 id="full">Full</h2>

This is the most ergonomic setup, as it enables me to get the top of the screen at eye level (as is widely suggested, see [Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety(https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/office/monitor_positioning.html) for example). When I‚Äôm at home, or can bring everything this is my preferred setup</p>

<p>I find it helpful to be exposed to motivating images throughout the day. Sometimes when you feel like giving up, it helps being reminded of the goal. Whatever that means for you - building the next social nextwork, getting your first internship or advancing your career - you can find images that symobolizes that for you. Set these as backgrounds on your phone and laptop. For example I have this as my phone background:</p>

<p>I find it motivating to listen to podcasts discussing the area of programming I‚Äôm currently active in. For example, I learn JavaScript and enjoy listening to <a href="https://syntax.fm/">Syntax</a>. You can easily find podcasts about your specific area of study.</p>

<p>I also recommend the short documentaries from Honeypot on YouTube, especially the story of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI&amp;t=7s" target="\_blank">Vue.js</a>, and the one on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783ccP__No8" target="\_blank">GraphQL</a>.</p>

<p>Another inspiring documentary about programming (A.I. specifically) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y&amp;t=1329s">AlphaGo</a> which is streaming for free on YouTube as well.</p>

<h2 id="take-breaks">Take breaks</h2>

<p>You might be tempted to stay on a problem for hours and hours without breaks (<em>‚ÄúJust 5 more minutes and I‚Äôll have it figured out‚Äù</em>). Learn to walk away, if only for 10-15 minutes, when you‚Äôve been stuck for a while. More often than not the solution will come to you, either during the break or quite soon upon returning to your computer.</p>

<h2 id="keep-learning">Keep learning!</h2>

<p>Just make sure you know a little bit more today than you did yesterday.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll stop there, before this turns into a complete clich√© party. Hopefully some of those speak to you and you can apply them to stay motivated. Thanks for reading.</p>
