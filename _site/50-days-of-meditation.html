<p>Meditation might seem like woo woo gimmickry practised by Silicon Valley hotshots, exuding a look-how-spiritual-and-at-the-same-time-succesful-I-am vibe. To a certain extent, this is exactly what it is. Or has become.</p>

<p>But let’s put the cynicism aside for a minute. Meditation comes up again and again as cornerstones in the daily habits of successful people whether mentioned in memoirs (Ray Dalio comes to mind as I read his masterpiece <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501124021/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1501124021&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=journeydev-20&amp;linkId=6948d692da83ca41e07adcb10f21818c" target="\_blank">Principles</a> last week) or interviews (recurring theme on <a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/" target="\_blank">Tim Ferriss’ podcast</a>, for example).</p>

<h2 id="the-scientific-evidence">The Scientific Evidence</h2>

<p>A team of Harvard researchers <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/sara_lazar/publications" target="\_blank">has found</a> found changes in brain chemistry after as little as 8 weeks of meditation practice. The changes include strengthening in areas that are involved in stress-reduction, empathy, memory and general cognition.</p>

<p>If you are still a skeptic, here are some books that might resonate with you:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062917609/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0062917609&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=journeydev-20&amp;linkId=f1dcf1d7dfee19223210bba4f7bc4ed5" target="\_blank"><b>10% Happier</b></a><b> by Dan Harris</b></p>

<p><img class="half-image" src="/assets/post-media/2020-07-05/ten_percent.jpg" /></p>

<p>Harris is a famous TV news anchor. He suffered a panic attack on live TV and was forced to reconsider his way of life and tackle underlying issues. He found meditation and describes that journey from the perspective of a “fidgety skeptic” slowly turning into a dedicated meditator. The subtitle to the book describes it well: <em>How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works</em>.</p>

<p>Stepping slightly closer to the woo woo zone here. The theme is similar to the two other books though: an initially skeptic career man (in this case a successful lawyer) is slowly persuaded by the ways of mindfulness practice. This book is great for more of the Buddhist approach, which runs through the other ones as well.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</h2>

<p>Even though the practice of meditating is extremely simple (sit down and notice <em>what already is</em>, I find it great to have some guidance to begin with. I have found Sam Harris’ approach very rational and easy to follow. Harris is a neuroscientist with a lot of content and ideas in the field of mindfulness and meditation. For background and motivation, you can pick up his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451636024/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1451636024&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=journeydev-20&amp;linkId=fda4f4d943635fcb0c3139ead9043968" target="\_blank">Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion</a>.</p>

<p>From there, I went on to subscribe to his recently launched meditation app, <a href="https://share.wakingup.com/e2add0">Waking Up</a>. The introductory course lasts for 50 days. There is a 10 minute daily practice to follow. It introduces new concepts at a slow pace while keeping the core themes in focus: Notice what is. Notice how easily you can change your state of mind. Direct your focus, narrow it, keep it on the breath or another object. Subject/object relationship. Loss of the self. And so on.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>I kept it up for 50 days. For the first 20 days it felt like a chore. I have been doing meditation before, but there are always periods when I fall off the wagon. This time I found it easier to stick to it, and after those first 20 days I started looking forward to that short break in the day. I found I had to do it in the morning. Thinking “I will do it later” proved to be the same as “I’ll skip today” for some reason. Realizing this was important. If you’re the same; try doing it first thing in the morning. After day 50 the app continues serving you daily meditations as well as lots of other content on mindfulness. For me it helped to successfully build that habit. And to feel the slight change in your mind. It might best be described as a small buffer between stimulus and response. And I find it easier to break negative thought patterns. Harris sums up the purpose of the practice in day 50:</p>

<p><em>The goal of meditation is not to become a meditator. Not even a good one. The goal is to recognize how the mind always already is. And to experience the freedom that is inherent to the nature of consciousness. Freedom from fear, and shame, and envy, and craving. Freedom from self.</em></p>

<h2 id="find-consistency">Find consistency</h2>

<p>There are tons of apps out there to help you build the habit. The Waking Up app worked for me. You can also try Headspace or Calm. In the end, consistency is key, however you achieve it.</p>
